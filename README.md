## Introduction üìù

In this project, we've leveraged the power of the MERN stack to build a robust web application. The backend API, built with Node.js and Express.js, handles data storage and retrieval using MongoDB as the database. On the frontend, we've utilized React.js to create a dynamic and responsive user interface, providing a seamless user experience.

## Features ‚ú®

- **Full-Stack Development**: Utilize the MERN stack to develop both backend and frontend components.
- **RESTful API**: Implement a RESTful API architecture for smooth communication between the client and server.
- **Scalable**: Built with scalability in mind, allowing easy expansion and addition of new features.
- **Modular Codebase**: Organize code into reusable and modular components for maintainability.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensure a responsive and user-friendly interface across different devices and screen sizes.

## Installation üõ†Ô∏è

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the `API` folder and run `npm install` to install backend dependencies.
3. Navigate to the `Client` folder and run `npm install` to install frontend dependencies.
4. Set up a MongoDB database and configure the connection in the backend (`API`) code.
5. Start the backend server by running `npm start` in the `API` folder.
6. Start the frontend development server by running `npm start` in the `Client` folder.
7. Open your browser and visit `http://localhost:3000` to view the application.

## Usage üöÄ

Once the project is set up locally, you can:

- Register an account or log in if you already have one.
- Explore the various features and functionalities provided by the application.
- Interact with the backend API endpoints to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on data.

## Technologies Used üíª

- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database used for data storage.
- **Express.js**: Web application framework for Node.js, used for building the backend API.
- **React.js**: JavaScript library for building user interfaces, used for the frontend client.
- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime environment used for running server-side code.
- **Git**: Version control system used for managing and tracking changes to the codebase.
- **GitHub**: Platform used for hosting the project repository and collaboration.
